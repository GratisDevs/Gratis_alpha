1. Added navbar updates. 
2. Task assigned to everyone.

1. Due to navbar design there are some inconsistencies. 
2. Probably by making the navbar items collapsible the login view would work properly.

1. Issue Raised : State Management of the alert in the forgot password page #1
2. Please see to it in the issues section.

1. Added a package for alert creation.
2. npm install sweetalert --save
3. Issue #1 resolved. Contributor - Vipul :"I have fixed the issue. You should read more about setState function of React. It is an asynchronous function. So javascript won't wait for it to get finished and will go ahead with the execution of other statements that follow setState. That is why even if you call setState before the second if condition, the state will contain old value. See in the code how I have resolved the issue."

1. GitHub Bot raised an issue.
2. Upgrade node-forge to version 0.10.0 or later. For example:

    "dependencies": {
        "node-forge": ">=0.10.0"
    }
3. Ignored as the issue was not that significant to our project.
