1. Added navbar updates. 
2. Task assigned to everyone.

[03-11-2020 23:58] - tarun

1. Due to navbar design there are some inconsistencies. 
2. Probably by making the navbar items collapsible the login view would work properly.

[04-11-2020 14:11] - tarun

1. Issue Raised : State Management of the alert in the forgot password page #1
2. Please see to it in the issues section.

[04-11-2020 21:54] - vipul

1. Added a package for alert creation.
2. npm install sweetalert --save
3. Issue #1 resolved. Contributor - Vipul :"I have fixed the issue. You should read more about setState function of React. It is an asynchronous function. So javascript won't wait for it to get finished and will go ahead with the execution of other statements that follow setState. That is why even if you call setState before the second if condition, the state will contain old value. See in the code how I have resolved the issue."

[05-11-2020 00:12] - tarun

1. GitHub Bot raised an issue.
2. Upgrade node-forge to version 0.10.0 or later. For example:

    "dependencies": {
        "node-forge": ">=0.10.0"
    }
3. Ignored as the issue was not that significant to our project.

[05-11-2020 00:14] - tarun

-Rule 1-

    1. You must post a clear and direct question in the title. The post may contain up to two, short context sentences only if they are necessary for understanding the question. Your title must end with a question and a question mark. All posts must be written in English so that they are widely understood by the user base of the sub.

In r/AskReddit, we only allow post titles without use of the text box for further elaboration. You are welcome to add further explanation in addition to your title in the regular comments section. "No Text Box" Rule Mod Post. December 9th, 2015. If you like posts which break rule 1, you might like these subs.

Any examples that could otherwise stand as an answer to the question should go in the comments section, and not be a part of your title. This includes posting questions which list exceptions, for example: “Other than ___” or “Besides ____” posts.

If you wish to tag your post NSFW, either put only the letters 'NSFW' before or after the post, or use the flair button. Introductory statements or claims, 'baiting' devices like 'Possibly NSFW', or non question-related information such as 'I'll start...' are a violation of this rule, and will result in the post being removed. Spelling errors that change the meaning of the question will be removed.

If you like posts which break rule 1, you might like these subs.
-Rule 2-

    2) AskReddit is NOT your personal or professional advice platform.

Any post asking for advice should be generic and not specific to your situation alone. Do not include first person pronouns in your title. In AskReddit, your title should always be about the question itself. If the question is focused on your personal story or is only relevant to your experience, it is not suitable for AskReddit. Crowdsourcing naming decisions, purchases, etc, is not appropriate.

Questions seeking professional advice are inappropriate for this subreddit and will be removed. This includes but is not limited to medical, legal, mental health, and financial advice. If you think that you need professional support, please contact a professional as the qualifications of anyone giving advice on reddit can not be verified. If it's serious enough for you to ask Reddit, it's serious enough for you to see a professional about it.

If you wish to receive advice on a specific topic, you might like these subreddits.
-Rule 3-

    3) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. Questions that already have a definite/correct answer OR may be researched easily (for example through Google) cannot be asked here.

We are not a replacement for Google. We are here to engage in constructive and entertaining discussion. Posts that do not promote such qualities may be removed. Questions that will have definite answers or limit responses to fewer than 3 words are not allowed. This includes Yes/No, DAE, Either/or, "would you rather", polls, surveys and fill-in-the-blank questions. You must ask for an explanation beyond a one word reply, such as "yes" or "no". Any other questions that limit word length, provide a small choice of responses, or ask for a brand name or title within a category without further elaboration will be removed. Also prohibited are posts seeking to compile NSFW-links (as top-level comments). Such posts are not conducive to active discussion, and there are other subreddits where they would be more appreciated.

Threads in which many of the responses are the same discourage discussion and will be removed. This includes (but is not limited to) post titles that begin with "How Would You Feel..." in which the post is leading individuals to largely agree or disagree with a concept without adding to the conversation, and where your own personal bias may be apparent in the content of the post title

Threads in which the first commenter is required to give one answer and the second commenter needs to add on in some way or argue the opposite point are not allowed because they tend to limit discussion by requiring what child comments can say.

If you like posts which break rule 3, you might like these subs.
-Rule 4-

    4) Posting or seeking any identifying personal information, real or fake, will result in a ban without a prior warning. This includes information about yourself or other people and refers to, but is not limited to: names, phone numbers, email addresses, or social media. Asking questions designed to draw attention to specific usernames related to social media, or posting comments to call out another Reddit user are also not allowed.

Regardless of intent, posting any information under the premise of being personally identifiable information is prohibited, and the person posting the information will be banned from the subreddit. This is a protective measure, because we cannot verify the accuracy of what is posted, nor defend against any unsavory intentions other users might have.

Please note: Rule 4 also applies to posting a user's history. It's permissible to link to a relevant comment from another thread or even another sub, but against the rules to post a link to something, even in the same thread, if it encourages going into that user's history or launching a personal attack. "Here's a relevant comment" comments are fine, but "Look at what I found in this user's history! See what else you can find" comments are not.
-Rule 5-

    5) Rhetorical and loaded questions (in which you are asserting an opinion, bias, or leading respondents towards expressing a specific opinion) will be removed. AskReddit is not your soapbox, personal army, or advertising platform. Posts attempting to promote a specific agenda, to gain publicity, promote a cause or charity drive, or to publicly shame a person or entity will be removed. This includes (but is not limited to) "How Would You Feel..." threads in which your own personal opinion may be apparent in the post title. Posts asking users to shame or call out specific people or groups will be removed because they lead to witch-hunting rather than discussion.

This isn't a place to recruit members for a cause, highlight an individual or entity for positive or negative publicity, or toot your own horn. Attempting to gain support for a movement, rig a contest, or form a vote brigade to other posts or comments on Reddit will result in immediate post removal. We're not here to do your bidding.

If you like posts which break rule 5, you might like these subs.
-Rule 6-

    6) -[Serious] Tags--

This tag designates the thread is is applied to as a serious post, off-limits for joke replies and irrelevant or off-topic comments and discussion. If the OP asks for answers from a specific group, top level comments must be made from members of that group. Other responses will be removed. To mark your thread as [Serious], simply put '[Serious]', in brackets, in the post title. AutoModerator will automatically assign the link flair, thoroughly indicating with both thread title and flair, that the post will be much more strictly moderated and that comments not pertaining to the discussion in a more serious manner are subject to removal. This includes every single comment (parent or child) in the thread. If you see an inappropriate comment in a [Serious] thread, please report it so that the mods can look it over. Note that the 'report' button is not an 'I disagree' button or a super-downvote, it will simply flag it for the mods' attention, and the comment will be evaluated for removal then. Mods will reserve the discretion to determine if a post is suited for a Serious tag. If there are no relevant answers within the first hour of posting, a [Serious] thread may be removed. Consider doing an AMA request instead! Novelty accounts are not permitted in serious threads.
-Rule 7-

    7) Soliciting money, goods, services, or favours are not allowed. They will be removed. Asking for Reddit rewards will warrant a ban.

Gaining publicity for a charity drive, assistance with a homework or work assignment, asking other Redditors for or offering to provide a good or service (including upvotes or reddit gold) is not conducive to discussion. There are other subreddits, many listed in our Offers & Assistance Multi-reddit, for just such a thing. Doing this, even as a joke, can result in a ban.

Brigading from other posts or comments, even from other subreddits, to an AskReddit post or comment may result in a ban. Brigading occurs when you make any attempt to direct online traffic to a post or comment for either positive or negative interaction with the content, including, but not limited to: asking for downvotes or upvotes, drawing in supporters to join a comment chain, or encouraging others to negatively interact with another user by linking to the AskReddit post or comment. Extreme cases of brigading will result in a permanent ban.

If you like posts which break rule 7, you might like these subs.
-Rule 8-

    8) All users are expected to be respectful to other users at all times and conduct their behaviour in a civil manner. Personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans.

Slur use is not allowed in AskReddit. Exceptions may be made when they are part of a quote, but this is a friendly subreddit and using slurs when talking to others will not be tolerated.

Don't be abusive or harass other users. Do not make blatant statements of bigotry, such as "I hate gays" or "Black people suck". Do not make jokes or statements that sexualize minors, as we have zero tolerance for this behaviour and you will be banned. Do not encourage suicide in any form, through humour or otherwise. Continuing arguments with other users over multiple comments is termed "slapfighting" and not allowed. Such behaviour may lead to comment removals and bans. In summary, any post or comment that is deemed to be intended to offend, demean, or otherwise egregiously disrespect others may warrant a removal or ban.

Comments and posts mentioning subreddits and websites deemed to be harmful, because of demeaning content, spam, etc., will be filtered. Unmarked NSFW links, unmarked spoilers, misleading links, spam, and the likes will will result in removal and potentially a ban. Editing comments and posts to mislead and/or advertise will result in removal of the post/comment and potentially a ban.

Shotgunning, in which you are making low-effort comments in reply to top-level comments in high frequency, is not allowed. Karmafarming, in which you are making low-effort comments or posts (including copying and pasting old comments or previously popular posts) for the majority of your contribution to the sub, is also prohibited. Mod actions in response to karmafarming are generally reserved for users taking low effort comments to an extreme. Users with a majority of low effort comments or posts that add little to the conversation may be banned.

Bans may be issued to users who disregard this rule.
-Rule 9-

    9) Comment replies consisting solely of images will be removed. ASCII images over one line are also not allowed. You may post single line emoticons (ಠ◡ಠ, ʘ‿ʘ, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ , etc.), but large ASCII images and vertical text do not add value to discussion and will be treated as spam.

Child comments (comment replies to other comments), that consist only of a link to an image/video will be removed. Links as part of a larger sentence giving context will still be permitted. For example,

    [random sentence made a link](http://www.reaction.gif)

or

    http://www.imgur.com/jpg

Will be removed, but a comment like this:

    Here is an example of a comment containing a [link](http://www.imgur.com/jpg).

will still be permitted. This is to prevent long chains of pictures, videos, or gifs that derail and detract from the conversation more than they contribute or progress it. Askreddit is a self-post only community focusing on discussion, and such comment replies only serve to derail the conversation, and are often 'spam' in nature.
